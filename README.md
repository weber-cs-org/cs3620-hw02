# HW02 Double-linked Stack

<First name - Last name>

## Problem statement

Implement the Backend of an ADT that represents a stack. The class contains two pointers that maintain key locations in
The Double-linked list.

```php
Node $headPtr;   // Pointer to first node in the chain;
Node $topPtr;    // Pointer to (last) node in the chain that contains the stack's top
```

You must write code in the class DLinkedStack, inside `DLinkedStack.php`.
The functions that are to be implemented by you are marked with a `// TODO`

## Constraints

* The Class must use Node from Node.php to represent a node.

## Files to work on

You are required to work on `README.md` and `/src/DLinkedStack.php`
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. Modifying any other file will result in penalty to your grade.

## Notes

* Make sure your runs. There are no points for code that doesn't run.
* The Initial template code will compile, but will fail in most of the test cases.
* It is recommended that you add your **name** and **travis ci badge** to your readme.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* Post questions in Discussions on Canvas if you have any questions.
